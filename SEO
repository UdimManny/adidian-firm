Here’s a practical SEO audit of adidianphysiotherapyclinic.com with specific, prioritized fixes and examples taken directly from your site.

Overall assessment
- Strong foundation: clear value proposition, local NAP shown, service scope defined, CTAs present, footer links included.[1]
- Biggest gaps: thin service URLs (many point to /blog/*), missing location targeting across key pages, likely weak on-page metadata, no visible schema, and probable technical performance issues (Core Web Vitals, image optimization).[1]

High-impact fixes (prioritized 0–30 days)

1) Local SEO and Google Business Profile alignment
- Ensure exact NAP consistency across:
  - Website footer: “No 32 Lord Lugard Street, Area 11, Garki, Abuja, Beside Efab Properties Ltd; 070-6587-3379; adidianphysiotherapyclinic@gmail.com”[1]
  - Google Business Profile (same spelling, punctuation, phone format)
  - Facebook/Instagram bios, LinkedIn, local directories (VConnect, Finelib, Bing Places, Apple Maps).
- Add an embedded Google Map on Contact and Home pages.
- Create location page:
  - URL: /abuja-physiotherapy-clinic
  - H1: Physiotherapy Clinic in Area 11, Garki, Abuja
  - Include directions, nearby landmarks (Efab Properties Ltd), parking, neighborhoods served, FAQs, and map.
- Add local business schema with coordinates, opening hours, sameAs profiles.

2) Fix site architecture and service URLs
- Replace “Learn More →” links that point to blog paths with real service pages. Examples from Home :[1]
  - Pain Management → /services/pain-management
  - Sports Rehabilitation → /services/sports-rehabilitation
  - Women’s Health → /services/womens-health-physiotherapy
  - Neurological Rehabilitation → /services/neurological-rehabilitation
  - Occupational Therapy and Ergonomics → /services/occupational-therapy-ergonomics
  - Pediatrics → /services/pediatric-physiotherapy
  - Geriatric Care → /services/geriatric-physiotherapy
  - Cardiovascular Rehabilitation → /services/cardiovascular-rehabilitation
  - Relaxation Massage → /services/relaxation-massage
- Each service page template should include:
  - H1 with service + location (e.g., Sports Physiotherapy in Abuja)
  - Intro paragraph with primary keyword and benefit
  - Conditions treated, methods used, session flow, outcomes, testimonials snippet, FAQ, internal links to related services and Contact/Book
  - Localized schema (Service) referencing the LocalBusiness entity
  - Unique meta title and description (see section 4)

3) On-page content optimization (EEAT + conversions)
- Home page enhancements:
  - Add social proof: number of patients helped, clinic photos, short patient quotes with first name + initial.
  - Expand “Why Choose Adidian?” with differentiators (licensed MRTB therapists, special equipment, home care availability, insurance/payment options).
  - Add section “Common Conditions We Treat” with internal links to service pages.
- Meet the Team page:
  - Add therapist bios with credentials (MRTB license, specialties, years of experience), headshots, and links to author pages.
  - Use Person schema for clinicians; author bylines on blog articles.
- Testimonials page:
  - Mark up with Review schema; avoid only 5-star—keep genuine and varied.
- Resources/Blog:
  - Create pain-condition clusters: e.g., Low Back Pain in Abuja, Neck Pain, Knee Pain, Stroke Rehab, Postpartum Recovery. Each with internal links to the relevant service page.

4) Metadata upgrades (titles, meta descriptions, headings)
- Home
  - Title: Physiotherapy Clinic in Abuja (Area 11, Garki) | Adidian Physiotherapy
  - Meta: Licensed physiotherapists in Area 11, Garki, Abuja. Pain management, sports rehab, neuro, women’s health, pediatrics, geriatrics. Book an appointment today.

  - Meta: Visit us at No 32 Lord Lugard Street, Area 11, Garki, Abuja. Call 070-6587-3379 or book online.

5) Technical SEO and performance
- Core Web Vitals
  - Compress/resize images, serve next-gen formats (WebP/AVIF).
  - Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold images.
  - Minify CSS/JS; defer non-critical JS. Reduce unused CSS from frameworks.
  - Use a CDN and enable caching headers.
- Indexability
  - Ensure a valid XML sitemap (include only canonical pages) and robots.txt.
  - Avoid thin/duplicate paths (e.g., services duplicated under blog).
- Security and UX
  - Verify valid SSL and canonical https redirects.
  - Mobile usability: large tap targets, font sizing, sticky CTA to “Book Appointment”.
- Accessibility
  - Alt text on all images (descriptive, not stuffed).
  - Proper heading hierarchy (one H1 per page).
- 404 and redirects
  - If you move blog URLs to service URLs, set 301 redirects to preserve any link equity.

6) Schema markup (JSON-LD)
- Organization/LocalBusiness (Healthcare/MedicalClinic)
  - name, address, geo, telephone, openingHours, sameAs (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn), areaServed.
- Service for each service page
  - serviceType, provider (points to LocalBusiness), areaServed, url.
- FAQ schema on FAQ page and service FAQs.
- BreadcrumbList for all pages.
- Person for clinicians; Article for blog posts with author.

7) Internal linking strategy
- From Home and Services hub, link to each service page using exact-match or close-variant anchor text.
- From condition blog posts to relevant service pages (e.g., “low back pain exercises” → Pain Management).
- From service pages to Contact and FAQs.
- Use footer mini-sitemap by service category to strengthen crawl paths.

8) Reviews and reputation building
- Launch a review acquisition flow:
  - Post-visit WhatsApp/SMS with direct Google review link.
  - Provide review prompts that mention service and location naturally.
- Display review snippets on key pages with schema. Respond to all reviews professionally and add monthly Google Posts with clinic updates.

9) Conversion rate optimization
- Add “Book Appointment” sticky button on mobile and top-right desktop.
- Simplify contact form (name, phone, reason, preferred time) and add click-to-call buttons near fold on mobile.
- Add trust badges (MRTB registration, years in practice, clinic photos).

10) Content roadmap (next 90 days)
- Build 9 service pages (as above).
- Publish 2 blog posts per month per cluster, e.g.:
  - Low Back Pain: causes, when to see a physio, 7 safe exercises, ergonomics for desk workers in Abuja.
  - Women’s Health: postpartum pelvic floor FAQs, diastasis recti recovery.
  - Neuro Rehab: stroke rehab stages, home exercise guide for caregivers.
- Create an “About Abuja Clinic” page targeting “physiotherapist in Area 11 Garki”.
- Add a “Home Physiotherapy in Abuja” page if you offer domiciliary care.
